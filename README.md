Open this file in your perfered text editor and go to line 907 and change the timeout to 0.0001. This should look like:

<hold action="craft_item"			  		timeout="0.0001" />

Make sure to restart your game after altering the file.

Within the run there is a crafting limit counter. Crafting tips are:

Set crafting limit to the amount of Bounce Back MK.1 that you have the materials for. Run the program, click into your game, hover over craft and hit s.
Disassemble and get 2x common materials and 3x uncommon.

To get rare & and epic materials craft Char Incendiary Grenades or Gash Antipersonnel Grenades.

After getting rare and epic materials you can create F-GX Frag Grenades to then craft Ozob's Nose for legendary upgrade materials.

To get legendary components you will need to craft them from 6 epic components.
